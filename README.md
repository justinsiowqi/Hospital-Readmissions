# Hospital Readmissions

## Overview

* This project is Codecademy's "Machine Learning Fundamentals Skill Path" Final Portfolio.
* Goal: Create a model to predict whether a patient will get readmitted within 30 days.
* Data: The dataset contains information from 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks across 10 years from 1999 to 2008.
* Analysis: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest were used to predict early readmissions. The models were then evaluated using...
